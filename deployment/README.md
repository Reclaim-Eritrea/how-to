# Deployment

DataMade generally uses Heroku for dynamic deployments and Netlify for static
deployments. However, we maintain a number of legacy applications deployed on
Amazon Web Services (AWS) infrastructure.

This directory contains documents relevant to all three platforms, as well as
miscellaneous deployment-related activities.

## Contents

- [AWS](./aws)
