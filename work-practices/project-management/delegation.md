# Delegation

When you need to hand a project off, it's important to provide context and set
expecations for the person receiving the work. At DataMade, we like to use
the delegation document provided by The Management Center as a jumping off
point.

Note that delegation is different from assigning work. When a technical lead
assigns a task to an implementer, the technical lead remains accountable for
the end result. Conversely, delegation is the transfer of accountability. It
can be temporary, as in a period of leave, or permanent, as in company exits.

Much literal and proverbial ink has been spilled on why, when, and how to
delegate. At DataMade, we like [the resources produced by The Management
Center](https://www.managementcenter.org/tools/delegation/), in particular
their delegation document, which provides helpful prompts for key information
about the work to be delegated.
