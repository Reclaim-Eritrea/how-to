_ðŸ“š Doing all sorts of things, the DataMade way_

## What's this?

Here at DataMade, we do a lot of computer programming. Sometimes, we create entire repos dedicated to the practices we employ:

- [Making Data, the DataMade Way](https://github.com/datamade/data-making-guidelines)
- [Analyzing Data, the DataMade Way](https://github.com/datamade/data-analysis-guidelines)
- [Writing Tests, the DataMade Way](https://github.com/datamade/testing-guidelines)

But our daily computing also involves a lot of small, but important, tasks. In the spirit of [better living through documentation](https://datamade.us/blog/better-living-through-documentation), we're preserving guides to those tasks, here.
