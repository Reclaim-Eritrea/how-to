# External meetings

External meetings are typically scheduled and managed by one or more partners. All meetings are scheduled on our respective [Google Calendars](../remote-work#google-calendar).

## Calendly

DataMade uses [Calendly](https://calendly.com/) to schedule meetings with clients and other people outside DataMade. Calendly syncs directly with Google Calendar and removes a lot of the back & forth work typically spent finding available times to meet.

Currently, only partners have Calendly accounts. These are the currently available Calendly links:

* Derek: https://calendly.com/derek-eder
* Forest: https://calendly.com/fgregg
* Hannah: https://calendly.com/hc-garland

Calendly also supports joint scheduling for more than one person:

* Derek & Forest: https://calendly.com/derek-forest/
* Hannah & Forest: https://calendly.com/hannah-forest/
* Derek & Hannah: TBD
