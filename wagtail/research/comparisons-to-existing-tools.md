# Comparisons to existing tools

Over the past year DataMade has employed two CMS platforms:

- [Django CMS](https://www.django-cms.org/en/) for [Neighborhood Opportunity Fund](https://github.com/datamade/neighborhood-fund)
- [Wagtail](https://wagtail.io/) for [LISC CDNA](https://github.com/datamade/lisc-cnda) and the [Lugar Center Oversight Index](https://github.com/datamade/committee-oversight)

To facilitate deeper and more equal knowledge of CMS practices at DataMade, and thus speed up development time and improve maintainability, we should pick a single CMS tool and systematize its use.

## Wagtail vs. Django CMS

Both Wagtail and Django CMS are built for use with Django, but we were surprised to learn that they ask developers to employ substantially different modes of thinkingâ€”the way the two CMSs structure their data across views and models is quite different.

Django CMS operates with plugin-based abstractions, where pages are build from discrete reusable units. It has some recommended default plugins, like a text box and image field, and the ability to build and insert custom plugins. In contrast, Wagtail relies on template-based abstractions. It encourages developers to write reusable templates with different page layouts, and has a useful [StreamField](https://docs.wagtail.io/en/stable/topics/streamfield.html) model that allows some flexibility in pages built from the same template.

In our experience, Wagtail is both easier to set up for developers and easier to use for content managers.

- While Django CMS's large community-built plugin library initially looked promising, we found that both third-party and default plugins for basic functions, such as rich text boxes to allow users to input and style text, had confusing interfaces and were often buggy.
- In terms of user experience, we found that Wagtail's backend interface is easier for users to pick up. While Django CMS offers greater flexibility and encourages users to simply click on section of a page to change it, in practice this was overwhelming. In contrast, Wagtail intentionally separates page design from content management in a way that usefully restricts users from changing too many pieces of a page at once.
- Overall, we found the Wagtail documentation more robust and reliable.
