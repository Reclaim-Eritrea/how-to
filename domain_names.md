DataMade uses namecheap.com as our domain name provider.

If we are setting up a domain name, Derek Eder should purchase the domain name. Currently, we the DataMade domain names are under his personal account.

After purchase, Derek will share administrative privileges for the domain name with all partners and lead developers.
